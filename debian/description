At its core, Pacemaker is a distributed finite state machine capable of
co-ordinating the startup and recovery of inter-related services across
a set of machines.

Pacemaker understands many different resource types (OCF, SYSV, systemd)
and can accurately model the relationships between them (colocation,
ordering).

It can even use technology such as Docker to automatically isolate the
resources managed by the cluster.

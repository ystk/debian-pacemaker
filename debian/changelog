  * Changes made while producing Debian packages
  + Change distribution from sid to experimental
  + Remove autoconf automake autoheader on clean as these
    end up as symlinks which dpkg-source can't handle
  + Remove libltdl.tar on as this is a binary which dpkg-source can't handle
  + Make sure configure and py-compile are executable if present
  + Remove build-stamp on clean, otherwise the package can't be rebuilt
  + Remove lib64 path mangling code from configure,
    it seems to be broken on Debian
  + Use dh_install instead of dh_movefiles
    - Remove debian/*.files debian/*.dirs
      These files are not needed, as debian/*.install is used.
      They should be removed from upstream.  
  + Use dh_clean and dh_auto_clean in clean target of debian/rules
  + Use dh_prep instead of dh_clean in build target of debian/rules

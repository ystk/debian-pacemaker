== What Changed in 1.0 ==

=== New ===

* Failure timeouts. See <<s-failure-migration>>
* New section for resource and operation defaults. See <<s-resource-defaults>> and <<s-operation-defaults>>
* Tool for making offline configuration changes. See <<s-config-sandboxes>>
* +Rules, instance_attributes, meta_attributes+ and sets of operations can be defined once and referenced in multiple places. See <<s-reusing-config-elements>>
* The CIB now accepts XPath-based create/modify/delete operations. See the pass:[<command>cibadmin</command>] help text.
* Multi-dimensional colocation and ordering constraints. See <<s-resource-sets-ordering>> and <<s-resource-sets-colocation>>
* The ability to connect to the CIB from non-cluster machines. See <<s-remote-connection>>
* Allow recurring actions to be triggered at known times. See <<s-recurring-start>>


=== Changed ===

* Syntax
** All resource and cluster options now use dashes (-) instead of underscores (_)
** +master_slave+ was renamed to +master+
** The +attributes+ container tag was removed
** The operation field +pre-req+ has been renamed +requires+
** All operations must have an +interval+, +start+/+stop+ must have it set to zero
* The +stonith-enabled+ option now defaults to true.
* The cluster will refuse to start resources if +stonith-enabled+ is true (or unset) and no STONITH resources have been defined
* The attributes of colocation and ordering constraints were renamed for clarity. See <<s-resource-ordering>> and <<s-resource-colocation>>
* +resource-failure-stickiness+ has been replaced by +migration-threshold+. See <<s-failure-migration>>
* The parameters for command-line tools have been made consistent
* Switched to 'RelaxNG' schema validation and 'libxml2' parser
** id fields are now XML IDs which have the following limitations:
*** id's cannot contain colons (:)
*** id's cannot begin with a number
*** id's must be globally unique (not just unique for that tag)
** Some fields (such as those in constraints that refer to resources) are IDREFs.
+
This means that they must reference existing resources or objects in
order for the configuration to be valid.  Removing an object which is
referenced elsewhere will therefore fail.
+              
** The CIB representation, from which a MD5 digest is calculated to verify CIBs on the nodes, has changed.
+
This means that every CIB update will require a full refresh on any
upgraded nodes until the cluster is fully upgraded to 1.0.  This will
result in significant performance degradation and it is therefore
highly inadvisable to run a mixed 1.0/0.6 cluster for any longer than
absolutely necessary.
+              
* Ping node information no longer needs to be added to _ha.cf_.
+
Simply include the lists of hosts in your ping resource(s).


=== Removed ===


* Syntax
** It is no longer possible to set resource meta options as top-level
   attributes.  Use meta attributes instead.
** Resource and operation defaults are no longer read from
   +crm_config+.  See <<s-resource-defaults>> and
   <<s-operation-defaults>> instead.

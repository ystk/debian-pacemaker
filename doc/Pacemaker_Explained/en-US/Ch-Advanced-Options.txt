== Connecting from a Remote Machine ==
indexterm:[Cluster,Remote connection]
indexterm:[Cluster,Remote administration]

Provided Pacemaker is installed on a machine, it is possible to
connect to the cluster even if the machine itself is not in the same
cluster.  To do this, one simply sets up a number of environment
variables and runs the same commands as when working on a cluster
node.

.Environment Variables Used to Connect to Remote Instances of the CIB

|Environment Variable

|CIB_user
|$USER
|The user to connect as. Needs to be part of the +hacluster+ group on
 the target host.
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,CIB_user]

|CIB_passwd

|The user's password. Read from the command line if unset.

|=========================================================

So, if *c001n01* is an active cluster node and is listening on port 1234
for connections, and *someuser* is a member of the *hacluster* group,
then the following would prompt for *someuser*'s password and return
the cluster's current configuration:

----
# export CIB_port=1234; export CIB_server=c001n01; export CIB_user=someuser;
# cibadmin -Q
----

For security reasons, the cluster does not listen for remote
connections by default.  If you wish to allow remote access, you need
to set the +remote-tls-port+ (encrypted) or +remote-clear-port+
(unencrypted) CIB properties (i.e., those kept in the +cib+ tag, like
+num_updates+ and +epoch+).

[[s-recurring-start]]
== Specifying When Recurring Actions are Performed ==


By default, recurring actions are scheduled relative to when the
resource started.  So if your resource was last started at 14:32 and
you have a backup set to be performed every 24 hours, then the backup
will always run at in the middle of the business day -- hardly
desirable.

To specify a date and time that the operation should be relative to, set
the operation's +interval-origin+.  The cluster uses this point to
calculate the correct +start-delay+ such that the operation will occur
at _origin + (interval * N)_.

So, if the operation's interval is 24h, its interval-origin is set to
02:00 and it is currently 14:32, then the cluster would initiate
the operation with a start delay of 11 hours and 28 minutes.  If the
resource is moved to another node before 2am, then the operation is
cancelled.

The value specified for +interval+ and +interval-origin+ can be any
date/time conforming to the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO8601 standard].  By way of
example, to specify an operation that would run on the first Monday of
2009 and every Monday after that, you would add:

== Moving Resources ==
indexterm:[Moving,Resources] 
indexterm:[Resource,Moving]

=== Moving Resources Manually ===

There are primarily two occasions when you would want to move a
resource from its current location: when the whole node is under
maintenance, and when a single resource needs to be moved.

==== Standby Mode ====

Since everything eventually comes down to a score, you could create
constraints for every resource to prevent them from running on one
node.  While pacemaker configuration can seem convoluted at times, not even
we would require this of administrators.

Instead, one can set a special node attribute which tells the cluster
"don't let anything run here".  There is even a helpful tool to help
query and set it, called `crm_standby`.  To check the standby status
of the current machine, run:

----
# crm_standby -G
----

A value of +on+ indicates that the node is _not_ able to host any
resources, while a value of +off+ says that it _can_.

You can also check the status of other nodes in the cluster by
specifying the `--node` option:

----
# crm_standby -G --node sles-2
----

To change the current node's standby status, use `-v` instead of `-G`:

----
# crm_standby -v on
----

Again, you can change another host's value by supplying a hostname with `--node`.

==== Moving One Resource ====

When only one resource is required to move, we could do this by creating
location constraints.  However, once again we provide a user-friendly
shortcut as part of the `crm_resource` command, which creates and
modifies the extra constraints for you.  If +Email+ were running on
+sles-1+ and you wanted it moved to a specific location, the command
would look something like:
        
----
# crm_resource -M -r Email -H sles-2
----

Behind the scenes, the tool will create the following location constraint:

[source,XML]
<rsc_location rsc="Email" node="sles-2" score="INFINITY"/>

It is important to note that subsequent invocations of `crm_resource
-M` are not cumulative. So, if you ran these commands

----
# crm_resource -M -r Email -H sles-2
# crm_resource -M -r Email -H sles-3
----

then it is as if you had never performed the first command.

To allow the resource to move back again, use:

----
# crm_resource -U -r Email
----

Note the use of the word _allow_.  The resource can move back to its
original location but, depending on +resource-stickiness+, it might
stay where it is.  To be absolutely certain that it moves back to
+sles-1+, move it there before issuing the call to `crm_resource -U`:
        
----
# crm_resource -M -r Email -H sles-1
# crm_resource -U -r Email
----

Alternatively, if you only care that the resource should be moved from
its current location, try:

----
# crm_resource -B -r Email
----

Which will instead create a negative constraint, like

[source,XML]
<rsc_location rsc="Email" node="sles-1" score="-INFINITY"/>

This will achieve the desired effect, but will also have long-term
consequences.  As the tool will warn you, the creation of a
+-INFINITY+ constraint will prevent the resource from running on that
node until `crm_resource -U` is used.  This includes the situation
where every other cluster node is no longer available!

In some cases, such as when +resource-stickiness+ is set to
+INFINITY+, it is possible that you will end up with the problem
described in <<node-score-equal>>.  The tool can detect
some of these cases and deals with them by creating both
positive and negative constraints. E.g.

+Email+ prefers +sles-1+ with a score of +-INFINITY+

+Email+ prefers +sles-2+ with a score of +INFINITY+

which has the same long-term consequences as discussed earlier.

[[s-failure-migration]]
=== Moving Resources Due to Failure ===

Normally, if a running resource fails, pacemaker will try to start
it again on the same node. However if a resource fails repeatedly,
it is possible that there is an underlying problem on that node, and you
might desire trying a different node in such a case.

indexterm:[migration-threshold]
indexterm:[failure-timeout]
indexterm:[start-failure-is-fatal]

Pacemaker allows you to set your preference via the +migration-threshold+
resource option.
footnote:[
The naming of this option was perhaps unfortunate as it is easily
confused with live migration, the process of moving a resource from
one node to another without stopping it.  Xen virtual guests are the
most common example of resources that can be migrated in this manner.
]

Simply define +migration-threshold=pass:[<replaceable>N</replaceable>]+ for a resource and it will
migrate to a new node after 'N' failures.  There is no threshold defined
by default.  To determine the resource's current failure status and
limits, run `crm_mon --failcounts`.

By default, once the threshold has been reached, the troublesome node will no
longer be allowed to run the failed resource until the administrator
manually resets the resource's failcount using `crm_failcount` (after
hopefully first fixing the failure's cause).  Alternatively, it is possible
to expire them by setting the +failure-timeout+ option for the resource.

For example, a setting of +migration-threshold=2+ and +failure-timeout=60s+
would cause the resource to move to a new node after 2 failures, and
allow it to move back (depending on stickiness and constraint scores) after one
minute.

There are two exceptions to the migration threshold concept:
when a resource either fails to start or fails to stop.

If the cluster property +start-failure-is-fatal+ is set to +true+ (which is the
default), start failures cause the failcount to be set to +INFINITY+ and thus
always cause the resource to move immediately.

Stop failures are slightly different and crucial.  If a resource fails
to stop and STONITH is enabled, then the cluster will fence the node
in order to be able to start the resource elsewhere.  If STONITH is
not enabled, then the cluster has no way to continue and will not try
to start the resource elsewhere, but will try to stop it again after
the failure timeout.

[IMPORTANT]
Please read <<s-rules-recheck>> to understand how timeouts work
before configuring a +failure-timeout+.

=== Moving Resources Due to Connectivity Changes ===

You can configure the cluster to move resources when external connectivity is
lost in two steps.

==== Tell Pacemaker to Monitor Connectivity ====

First, add an *ocf:pacemaker:ping* resource to the cluster.  The
*ping* resource uses the system utility of the same name to a test whether
list of machines (specified by DNS hostname or IPv4/IPv6 address) are
reachable and uses the results to maintain a node attribute called +pingd+
by default.
footnote:[
The attribute name is customizable, in order to allow multiple ping groups to be defined.
]

[NOTE]
===========
Older versions of Heartbeat required users to add ping nodes to +ha.cf+, but
this is no longer required.

Older versions of Pacemaker used a different agent *ocf:pacemaker:pingd* which
is now deprecated in favor of *ping*. If your version of Pacemaker does not
contain the *ping* resource agent, download the latest version from
https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/tree/master/extra/resources/ping
===========

Normally, the ping resource should run on all cluster nodes, which means that
you'll need to create a clone.  A template for this can be found below
along with a description of the most interesting parameters.

===========
You're only half done.  The next section deals with telling Pacemaker
how to deal with the connectivity status that +ocf:pacemaker:ping+ is
recording.
===========

==== Tell Pacemaker How to Interpret the Connectivity Data ====

[IMPORTANT]
======
Before attempting the following, make sure you understand
<<ch-rules>>.
======

There are a number of ways to use the connectivity data.

The most common setup is for people to have a single ping
target (e.g. the service network's default gateway), to prevent the cluster
from running a resource on any unconnected node.

.Don't run a resource on unconnected nodes
=====
[source,XML]
-------
<rsc_location id="WebServer-no-connectivity" rsc="Webserver">
   <rule id="ping-exclude-rule" score="-INFINITY" >
    <expression id="ping-exclude" attribute="pingd" operation="not_defined"/>
   </rule>
</rsc_location>
-------
=====

A more complex setup is to have a number of ping targets configured.
You can require the cluster to only run resources on nodes that can
connect to all (or a minimum subset) of them.

.Run only on nodes connected to three or more ping targets.
=====
[source,XML]
-------
<primitive id="ping" provider="pacemaker" class="ocf" type="ping">
... <!-- omitting some configuration to highlight important parts -->
      <nvpair id="pingd-multiplier" name="multiplier" value="1000"/>
...
</primitive>
...
<rsc_location id="WebServer-connectivity" rsc="Webserver">
   <rule id="ping-prefer-rule" score="-INFINITY" >
      <expression id="ping-prefer" attribute="pingd" operation="lt" value="3000"/>
   </rule>
</rsc_location>
-------
=====

Alternatively, you can tell the cluster only to _prefer_ nodes with the best
connectivity.  Just be sure to set +multiplier+ to a value higher than
that of +resource-stickiness+ (and don't set either of them to
+INFINITY+).

.Prefer the node with the most connected ping nodes
=====
[source,XML]
-------
<rsc_location id="WebServer-connectivity" rsc="Webserver">
   <rule id="ping-prefer-rule" score-attribute="pingd" >
    <expression id="ping-prefer" attribute="pingd" operation="defined"/>
   </rule>
</rsc_location>
-------
=====

It is perhaps easier to think of this in terms of the simple
constraints that the cluster translates it into.  For example, if
*sles-1* is connected to all five ping nodes but *sles-2* is only
connected to two, then it would be as if you instead had the following
constraints in your configuration:

.How the cluster translates the above location constraint
=====
[source,XML]
-------
<rsc_location id="ping-1" rsc="Webserver" node="sles-1" score="5000"/>
<rsc_location id="ping-2" rsc="Webserver" node="sles-2" score="2000"/>
-------
=====

The advantage is that you don't have to manually update any
constraints whenever your network connectivity changes.

You can also combine the concepts above into something even more
complex.  The example below shows how you can prefer the node with the
most connected ping nodes provided they have connectivity to at least
three (again assuming that +multiplier+ is set to 1000).

.A more complex example of choosing a location based on connectivity

   </rule>
   <rule id="ping-prefer-rule" score-attribute="pingd" >
    <expression id="ping-prefer" attribute="pingd" operation="defined"/>
   </rule>
</rsc_location>
-------
=====

=== Migrating Resources ===

Normally, when the cluster needs to move a resource, it fully restarts
the resource (i.e. stops the resource on the current node
and starts it on the new node).

However, some types of resources, such as Xen virtual guests, are able to move to
another location without loss of state (often referred to as live migration
or hot migration). In pacemaker, this is called resource migration.
Pacemaker can be configured to migrate a resource when moving it,
rather than restarting it.

Not all resources are able to migrate; see the Migration Checklist
below, and those that can, won't do so in all situations.
Conceptually, there are two requirements from which the other
prerequisites follow:

* The resource must be active and healthy at the old location; and
* everything required for the resource to run must be available on
  both the old and new locations.

The cluster is able to accommodate both 'push' and 'pull' migration models
by requiring the resource agent to support two special actions:
+migrate_to+ (performed on the current location) and +migrate_from+
(performed on the destination).

In push migration, the process on the current location transfers the
resource to the new location where is it later activated.  In this
scenario, most of the work would be done in the +migrate_to+ action
and, if anything, the activation would occur during +migrate_from+.

Conversely for pull, the +migrate_to+ action is practically empty and
+migrate_from+ does most of the work, extracting the relevant resource
state from the old location and activating it.

There is no wrong or right way for a resource agent to implement migration,
as long as it works.

.Migration Checklist
* The resource may not be a clone.
* The resource must use an OCF style agent.
* The resource must not be in a failed or degraded state.
* The resource agent must support +migrate_to+ and
  +migrate_from+ actions, and advertise them in its metadata.
* The resource must have the +allow-migrate+ meta-attribute set to
  +true+ (which is not the default).

If an otherwise migratable resource depends on another resource
via an ordering constraint, there are special situations in which it will be
restarted rather than migrated.

For example, if the resource depends on a clone, and at the time the resource
needs to be moved, the clone has instances that are stopping and instances
that are starting, then the resource will be restarted.
The Policy Engine is not yet able to model this
situation correctly and so takes the safer (if less optimal) path.

In pacemaker 1.1.11 and earlier, a migratable resource will be restarted
when moving if it directly or indirectly depends on 'any' primitive or group
resources.

Even in newer versions, if a migratable resource depends on a non-migratable
resource, and both need to be moved, the migratable resource will be restarted.

[[s-reusing-config-elements]]
== Reusing Rules, Options and Sets of Operations ==

Sometimes a number of constraints need to use the same set of rules,
and resources need to set the same options and parameters.  To
simplify this situation, you can refer to an existing object using an
+id-ref+ instead of an id.

So if for one resource you have

[source,XML]
------
<rsc_location id="WebServer-connectivity" rsc="Webserver">
   <rule id="ping-prefer-rule" score-attribute="pingd" >
    <expression id="ping-prefer" attribute="pingd" operation="defined"/>
   </rule>
</rsc_location>
------

Then instead of duplicating the rule for all your other resources, you can instead specify:

.Referencing rules from other constraints
=====
[source,XML]
-------
<rsc_location id="WebDB-connectivity" rsc="WebDB">
      <rule id-ref="ping-prefer-rule"/>
</rsc_location>
-------
=====

[IMPORTANT]
===========
The cluster will insist that the +rule+ exists somewhere.  Attempting
to add a reference to a non-existing rule will cause a validation
failure, as will attempting to remove a +rule+ that is referenced
elsewhere.
===========

The same principle applies for +meta_attributes+ and
+instance_attributes+ as illustrated in the example below:

.Referencing attributes, options, and operations from other resources

== Reloading Services After a Definition Change ==

The cluster automatically detects changes to the definition of
services it manages.  The normal response is to stop the
service (using the old definition) and start it again (with the new
definition).  This works well, but some services are smarter and can
be told to use a new set of options without restarting.

To take advantage of this capability, the resource agent must:

These pieces include the resources themselves; scripts that start, stop and monitor them; and a local daemon that masks the differences between the different standards these scripts implement.

These events include nodes joining or leaving the cluster; resource events caused by failures, maintenance and scheduled activities; and other administrative actions. Pacemaker will compute the ideal state of the cluster and plot a path to achieve it after any of these events. This may include moving resources, stopping nodes and even forcing them offline with remote power switches."

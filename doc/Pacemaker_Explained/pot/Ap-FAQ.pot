msgid "<indexterm> <primary>Pacemaker</primary> </indexterm> First of all, the reason it’s not called the CRM is because of the abundance of terms <footnote><para><ulink url=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRM\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRM</ulink></para></footnote> that are commonly abbreviated to those three letters. The Pacemaker name came from Kham, <footnote><para><ulink url=\"http://khamsouk.souvanlasy.com/\">http://khamsouk.souvanlasy.com/</ulink></para></footnote> a good friend of Pacemaker developer Andrew Beekhof’s, and was originally used by a Java GUI that Beekhof was prototyping in early 2007. Alas, other commitments prevented the GUI from progressing much and, when it came time to choose a name for this project, Lars Marowsky-Bree suggested it was an even better fit for an independent CRM. The idea stems from the analogy between the role of this software and that of the little device that keeps the human heart pumping. Pacemaker monitors the cluster and intervenes when necessary to ensure the smooth operation of the services it provides. There were a number of other names (and acronyms) tossed around, but suffice to say \"Pacemaker\" was the best."

Corosync 2 is the current state of the art due to its more advanced features and better support for pacemaker, but often the best choice is to use whatever comes with your Linux distribution, and follow the distribution’s setup instructions."

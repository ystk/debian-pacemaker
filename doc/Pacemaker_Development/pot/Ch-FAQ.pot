Pacemaker uses <ulink url=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git</ulink> for source code management. If you are a Git newbie, the <ulink url=\"http://schacon.github.io/git/gittutorial.html\">gittutorial(7) man page</ulink> is an excellent starting point. If you’re familiar with using Git from the command line, you can create a local copy of the Pacemaker source code with: <literal>git clone https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker.git pacemaker</literal>"

msgid "You’ll be mostly fine if you simply follow the example of existing code. When unsure, see the relevant section of this document for language-specific recommendations. Pacemaker has grown and evolved organically over many years, so you will see much code that doesn’t conform to the current guidelines. We discourage making changes solely to bring code into conformance, as any change requires developer time for review and opens the possibility of adding bugs. However, new code should follow the guidelines, and it is fine to bring lines of older code into conformance when modifying that code for other reasons."

msgid "<indexterm> <primary>git</primary><secondary>commit messages</secondary> </indexterm> <indexterm> <primary>commit messages</primary> </indexterm> See existing examples in the git log. The first line should look like <literal>change-type: affected-code: explanation</literal> where <literal>change-type</literal> can be <literal>Fix</literal> or <literal>Bug</literal> for most bug fixes, <literal>Feature</literal> for new features, <literal>Log</literal> for changes to log messages or handling, <literal>Doc</literal> for changes to documentation or comments, or <literal>Test</literal> for changes in CTS and regression tests. You will sometimes see <literal>Low</literal>, <literal>Med</literal> (or <literal>Mid</literal>) and <literal>High</literal> used instead for bug fixes, to indicate the severity. The important thing is that only commits with <literal>Feature</literal>, <literal>Fix</literal>, <literal>Bug</literal>, or <literal>High</literal> will automatically be included in the change log for the next release. The <literal>affected-code</literal> is the name of the component(s) being changed, for example, <literal>crmd</literal> or <literal>libcrmcommon</literal> (it’s more free-form, so don’t sweat getting it exact). The <literal>explanation</literal> briefly describes the change. The git project recommends the entire summary line stay under 50 characters, but more is fine if needed for clarity. Except for the most simple and obvious of changes, the summary should be followed by a blank line and then a longer explanation of <emphasis>why</emphasis> the change was made."

Additionally, Pacemaker’s Cluster Test Suite (CTS) can be used to set up a test cluster and run a wide variety of complex tests. This document will have more detail on testing in the future."

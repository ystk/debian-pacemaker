msgid "STONITH is an acronym for Shoot-The-Other-Node-In-The-Head and it protects your data from being corrupted by rogue nodes or concurrent access."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "Just because a node is unresponsive, this doesn’t mean it isn’t accessing your data. The only way to be 100% sure that your data is safe, is to use STONITH so we can be certain that the node is truly offline, before allowing the data to be accessed from another node."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "STONITH also has a role to play in the event that a clustered service cannot be stopped. In this case, the cluster uses STONITH to force the whole node offline, thereby making it safe to start the service elsewhere."

msgid "It is crucial that the STONITH device can allow the cluster to differentiate between a node failure and a network one."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "The biggest mistake people make in choosing a STONITH device is to use remote power switch (such as many on-board IMPI controllers) that shares power with the node it controls. In such cases, the cluster cannot be sure if the node is really offline, or active and suffering from a network fault."

msgid "Likewise, any device that relies on the machine being active (such as SSH-based \"devices\" used during testing) are inappropriate."

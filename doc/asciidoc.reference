== Go-to reference chapter for how we use AsciiDoc on this project ==

[NOTE]
======
This is *not* an attempt for fully self-hosted AsciiDoc document,
consider it a plaintext full of AsciiDoc samples (it's up to the reader
to recognize the borderline) at documentation writers' disposal
to somewhat standardize the style{empty}footnote:[
  style of both source notation and final visual appearance
].

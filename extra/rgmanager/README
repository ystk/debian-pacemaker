# Legacy: Linux-cluster cluster.conf to Pacemaker CIB translation utility

This directory used contain several parts related to the procedure of
cluster stacks/configuration migration, in particular and as the directory
name suggests: from (CMAN+RGManager)-based stack of HA components to
the (Corosync+Pacemaker)-based one.

This initial effort laid here was used as a foundation for a more
sophisticated and maintained tool, [clufter](https://github.com/jnpkrn/clufter),
which has made local tool-set obsolete since then.

In case any dependencies on previously offered bits arose as time was
passing by, a mapping to the clufter-provided alternatives is provided:

* `ccs2cib.in` resulting in `ccs2cib` conversion launcher
  - use `clufter ccs2pcs` (perhaps with some switches) and wrap it with
    some usage-specific script if suitable
* `ccs_flatten.c` and the rest of C-files resulting in `ccs_flatten` binary
  - you can find the same modulo few modifications in `ccs-flatten`
    subdirectory within the released tarballs or repo itself
    and the resulting binary is a crucial part of clufter installation
* `cluconf2cib.xsl`
  - deprecated in favor of multiple, sequentially chained XSL stylesheets
    decomposed into tree-like structure (refer to `filters/cluster`
    subdirectory but beware, it is accompanied with transformations for
    various other purposes)
* `disable_rgmanager.c` resulting in `disable_rgmanager` utility
  - use `clufter ccs-disable-rg` (since `clufter-0.12.0`)
* `tests` subdirectory
  - configs have been put under `tests/cluster.conf/orig` in clufter repo

# If pacemakerd doesn't stop, it's probably waiting on a cluster
# resource.  Sending -KILL will just get the node fenced

# If we ever hit the StartLimitInterval/StartLimitBurst limit and the
# admin wants to stop the cluster while pacemakerd is not running, it
# might be a good idea to enable the ExecStopPost directive below.
#
# Although the node will likely end up being fenced as a result so it's
# not on by default

# ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/killall -TERM crmd attrd stonithd cib pengine lrmd

# If you want Corosync to stop whenever Pacemaker is stopped,
# uncomment the next line too:
#
# ExecStopPost=/bin/sh -c 'pidof crmd || killall -TERM corosync'

# Uncomment this for older versions of systemd that didn't support
# TimeoutStopSec
# TimeoutSec=30min

# crm_perror() writes directly to stderr, so ignore it here

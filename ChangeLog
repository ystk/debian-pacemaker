* Mon Jan 14 2008 Andrew Beekhof <abeekhof@suse.de> - 0.6.0-1
- This is the first release of the Pacemaker Cluster Resource Manager formerly part of Heartbeat.
- For those looking for the GUI, mgmtd, CIM or TSA components, they are now found in
  the new pacemaker-pygui project.  Build dependencies prevent them from being
  included in Heartbeat (since the built-in CRM is no longer supported) and,
  being non-core components, are not included with Pacemaker.

- Test hardware:
    + 6-node vmware cluster (sles10-sp1/256Mb/vmware stonith) on a single host (opensuse10.3/2Gb/2.66Ghz Quad Core2)
    + 7-node EMC Centera cluster (sles10/512Mb/2Ghz Xeon/ssh stonith)
- Notes: Heartbeat Stack
    + All testing was performed with STONITH enabled
    + The CRM was enabled using the "crm respawn" directive
- Notes: OpenAIS Stack
    + This release contains a preview of support for the OpenAIS cluster stack
    + The current release of the OpenAIS project is missing two important
    patches that we require.  OpenAIS packages containing these patches are
    available for most major distributions at:
    http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/ha-clustering
    + The OpenAIS stack is not currently recommended for use in clusters that
    have shared data as STONITH support is not yet implimented
    + pingd is not yet available for use with the OpenAIS stack
    + 3 significant OpenAIS issues were found during testing of 4 and 6 node
    clusters.  We are activly working together with the OpenAIS project to
    get these resolved.
- Pending bugs encountered during testing:
    + OpenAIS   #1736 - Openais membership took 20s to stabilize
    + Heartbeat #1750 - ipc_bufpool_update: magic number in head does not match
    + OpenAIS   #1793 - Assertion failure in memb_state_gather_enter()
